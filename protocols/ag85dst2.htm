	  <h1>Data structure tree ag85dst2</h1>
	  <p>
	  AG85DST2 data structure is data structure tree as follows: every link is ag85dsp1 data structure (that is a number), the data structure tree starts with a root link and for every present state of every link there exists a child link, root of the data structure tree is considered to divide resulting sequence of presence states into so many portions as has presence states and child links except links of the last level of the data structure tree divides portions of corresponded present states in parents in the same way, every absent link of last level of the data structure tree in comparison to data structure tree all links except the last level of which contains only present states is considered to provide only not present states in resulting sequence of presence states, sequence of presence states of existing and absent links of the last level of the data structure tree in less-forward-deep-first-traversal order for links and as ag85dsp1 data structure provides for presence states order for presence states in the links represents resulting sequence of presence states.
