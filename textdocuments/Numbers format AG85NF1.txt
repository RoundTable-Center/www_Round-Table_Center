1. Parameters of the format are to be defined by either system or program/application/task and restrictions for these parameters are as follows:
	1.1) order of digits of byte is more-weighting-forward;
	1.2) size of each integer is some whole number of bytes;
	1.3) order of bytes in integer is more-weighting-forward;
2. Numeric space is as specified by protocol ag85nsp1;
3. By either system or program/application/task are specified base numbers of bytes for each integer;
4. Integers which require either base number of bytes or less than base number of bytes to be codded are codded by base number of bytes;
5. Integers which require more that base number of bytes to be codded are codded according to the following rules:
	5.1) firstly goes sign that a value is greater than maximum value of values of byte which are not signs;
	5.2) then go bytes with the integer;
	5.3) then goes sign that sequence ended;
6. Fractional numbers are presented by pair of divided integer and dividing integer and are codded according to the following rules:
	6.1) firstly goes sign of fractional number;
	6.2) then goes divided integer according to either paragraph 4 or paragraph 5 of this document correspondingly to how much bytes are required for codding the integer;
	6.3) then goes dividing integer according to either paragraph 4 or paragraph 5 of this document correspondingly to how much bytes are required for codding the integer.
