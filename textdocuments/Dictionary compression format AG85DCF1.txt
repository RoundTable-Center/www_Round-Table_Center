AG85DCF1 is of the following entities:
	1. Dictionaries – in custom way provide dictionary words so that there exists sequence numbering of the dictionary words in the dictionary;
	2. Dictionary extracts – of the following format:
		2.1. Dictionary extract part 1 – in either system or program/application/task defined format identification of used for defining used by the dictionary extract dictionaries so that there exists sequence order of the dictionaries;
		2.2. Dictionary extract part 2 – with compact numbering dictionary words through all dictionaries designated in dictionary extract part 1 in orders as the dictionaries are designated in dictionary extract part 1 and as dictionary words are sequenced in the dictionaries, in a system optimal way a set of numbers of dictionary words included in the dictionary extract;
	3. Archives – of the following format:
		3.1. Archive part 1 – in either system or program/application/task defined format identification what data is compressed into the archive;
		3.2. Archive part 2 – in either system or program/application/task defined format identification of used by the archive dictionary extracts so that there exists sequence order of the dictionary extracts;
		3.3. is empty if no grammar compression, Archive part 3 – in either system or program/application/task format identification of grammar programs and devices required for performing grammar decompression in order as processing by grammar programs and grammar devices is required;
		3.4. exists if archive part 3 is not empty, Archive part 4 – pieces of information for grammar decompression in order as processing by grammar programs and grammar devices is required;
		3.5. Archive part 5 – for every dictionary word which are represented in used by the archive dictionary extracts in a system optimal way a set:
			3.5.1. if archive part 6 is not empty, of position numbers of starting bytes of occurrences of the dictionary word in sequence of bytes of data compressed into the archive;
			3.5.2. if archive part 6 is empty, of position numbers of the dictionary word in sequence of dictionary words corresponding to data compressed into the archive without restrictions of how to convert pieces of data into dictionary words in variate cases;
		3.6. is empty if there were no such data pieces in compressed into the archive data, Archive part 6 – in the same order as in the data compressed into the archive pieces of data which are outside of pieces of data corresponding to dictionary words in the data compressed into the archive.
