1. Information space is distributed over the following:
	1.1. chars which can be with following functions:
		1.1.1. alphabets items so that if both numbers of numbers space and alphabet items has orders, items of an alphabet corresponds numbers of numbers space so that both orders are kept;
		1.1.2. optional - alphabets switchers/identifiers;
		1.1.3. is required if at least one group of lists chars and tables chars are supported – format delimiter;
		1.1.4. optional, require also format delimiter exists – lists format chars:
			1.1.4.1. start first or next list level sign;
			1.1.4.2. end current list level sign;
		1.1.5. optional, require also format delimiter exists – tables format chars:
			1.1.5.1. start first or next table dimension sign;
			1.1.5.2. end of table sign;
		1.1.6. for system and program/application/task language purposes;
		1.1.7. for system and program/application/task document design;
	1.2. optional - either system or program/application/task defined data verification;
	1.3. optional - either system or program/application/task defined grammar linking.
2. Sequences of chars can be separated into flows in either system or program/application/task defined way;
3. Lists of message parts are as follows:
	3.1. each list level (including first level) starts with start first or next list level sign and ends with end current list level sign;
	3.2. items (message parts) of any list level are separated by format delimiter and it is optional whether first item of the list level is preceded by format delimiter;
4. Tables of message parts are as follows:
	4.1. a table starts with start first or next table dimension sign and ends with end of table sign;
	4.2.  every next table dimension starts with start first or next table dimension sign;
	4.2.  table cell contents (message parts) are separated by format delimiter and it is optional whether first table cell content is preceded by format delimiter.
