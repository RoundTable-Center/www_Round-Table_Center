Threads</h1>
<p>Every program is a set of commands which also can be called
instructions; for example, to calculate something, to signal to a
device, to read from a channel. Diverse apparatuses can have very
diverse supported commands but it doesn’t change that in general
not all of actions can happen simultaneously; for example calculating
a result must occur before providing the result to an output device.
So some parts of programs are sequences of commands which by their
nature are to be performed in a certain order. If any parts of a
program contain commands that can be performed simultaneously, for
example providing result of previous calculations to an output device
and next  calculations, it can be considered as a specific parallel
part of commands sequence so that program stay be a sequence of
commands. Such sequences of programs are called threads. In general
there are some associated with currently being performed thread
resources, for example fast memory using by currently being performed
thread or security access information for the threads; which means
that a thread can switch flows of commands keeping associations with
the resources which in turn is that you can consider a thread as a
flow of commands associated with a set of designated for performing
commands resources.</p>
<p>So word threads can be used for three being executed sequences of
programs, sequences of command sets of stored programs and entities
with which resources for performing commands are associated.</p>
<p>Threads are performed by apparatuses from which it follows that
performing of commands of threads simultaneously besides by logic of
the commands is limited by what parts of threads can be done
simultaneously by apparatuses. Because in general parts of multiple
threads can’t be performed simultaneously in general there is some
dispatching of currently being performed commands, in another word of
threads. This dispatching depends on:</p>
<p>- how commands (note commands of multiple threads can depend on
each other too) depend on each other;</p>
<p>- what apparatuses can perform simultaneously.</p>
<p>Threads dispatching can be done by:</p>
<p>- threads themselves;</p>
<p>- either hardware or operating system.</p>

2: Things to consider on multithreading</h1>
<h2 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc81_89898606"></a>2.1:
Keeping correctness of data when multithreading</h2>
<h3 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc83_89898606"></a>2.1.1:
Problem of nonatomicity of operations</h3>
<p>When multiple threads operate with the same data there is a
problem that in general data operations are not atomic. Atomicity of
an operation is that it cannot be broken into parts. In the following
example of corruption because of absence of atomicity will be used
term byte, word byte means three a portion of information that has
its own address, a value of a portion of information that has its own
address and size of portions of information that have their own
addresses in a system. In the example of corruption because of
absence of atomicity word byte is used in both the first and the
second meanings. For example of corruption because of absence of
atomicity imagine that a program of multiple threads is operating
with a value of two bytes so that base of the first byte is 256 and
base of the second byte is 1 and resulting value is sum of (value of
the first byte * 256) and (value of the second byte * 1) and the
initial values of the bytes are  2 and 3 which for the program means
2 for base 256 and 3 for base 1 which means value (256*2)+(3*1)=515
and a situation that one of threads is reading the bytes and other is
changing so that to a moment of time the first of the threads has
read the first byte and the second of the threads changed both bytes
to 0 that is value 0 of the variable, completing of the operations is
the first of the threads reads the second byte so that for it the
bytes values will be 256 and 0 which means value (256*2)+(0*1)=512
which is neither initial, 515, nor set by the second of the threads 0
value. In case we are working from multiple threads with the same
value the only way to avoid corrupting values because operations can
be broken into parts is to avoid any other operations while
performing changing value operations.</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc85_89898606"></a>2.1.2:
Avoiding incompatible accesses</h3>
<h4 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc823_89898606 Copy 1"></a>
2.1.2.1: Making an operation atomic</h4>
<h5 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc823_89898606"></a>2.1.2.1.1:
Flagging that blocking operation is in progress</h5>
<p>The one way of avoiding any other operations while performing
changing value operation is just to deny the other operations while
performing changing value operation. Setting state that a changing
value operation is going to be performed means that you change some
value and so that there is guarantee that in turn this value is read
correctly there must be a guarantee by the system that the setting
state is atomic operation. An atomicity of an operation can be
realized in two ways:</p>
<p> - a system explicitly blocks other operations with the value;</p>
<p> - naturally atomic operation is used (for example transferring
through a single possible path).</p>
<h5 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc825_89898606"></a>2.1.2.1.2:
Barriering sets of commands</h5>
<p>Another way of avoiding any other operations while performing
changing value operation is to create barriers for commands so that
other operation commands start only after the changing value
operation has completed; this way requires explicit support by a
system.</p>
<h4 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc91_89898606"></a>2.1.2.2:
Different levels of granularity of atomicity</h4>
<p>When preventing incompatible access you protect the value, the
part of the storage of the value or the whole storage of the value;
it may be cheaper for a system to protect larger than the value
itself part of the data.</p>
<h4 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc89_89898606"></a>2.1.2.3:
Replacing pointer trick</h4>
<p>When you blocks other operations it may be not desired that other
threads wait for ending of the blocking; there is a way which may be
acceptable and cheaper or faster for a system of working with the
data through a pointer and changing copy of the data and after
changes have been complete to switch the pointer to the changes
instance; so other threads would be able to read through a pointer an
instance of data while another instance is being changed yet which is
would be able not wait until changing operation on the whole data is
completed but only for changing the pointer.</p>
<h2 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc899_3561902385"></a>2.2:
Thread pools</h2>
<p>When a program creates and deletes threads it has its cost and
when system switch from running one thread to running another one it
has its costs too. It may be cheaper or faster to switch your threads
from one set of commands to another without recreating threads and it
may be cheaper and faster to bind your threads to system resources to
avoid system switches among threads.</p>
<h2 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc95_89898606"></a>2.3:
Cachefriendliness</h2>
<p>Word cache means two data copied from an initial storage so that
information of the data can be accessed cheaper without reading from
initial storage so that the data access is cheaper or faster and
storage for such data. Sometimes caching is organized so that data is
replaced by portions of certain size; for example, a cache is divided
into portions of 8 bytes and you have one variable which was placed
into the first 4 bytes of the cache portion and another variable
which was placed into the second 4 bytes of the cache portion, when
you update one of the variable the whole cache portion is being
updated and if another threads is programmed to operates with another
variable it needs to wait until the cache portion is updated for
accessing that another variable. 
</p>
<p>The trick you can perform by cost of additional cache memory usage
is aligning a variable to take place of the whole portion which
forces to place any other variables in other cache portions; so
updating this variable won’t retain operating with other variables.</p>
<h2 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc901_3561902385"></a>2.4:
Storages for exchanging data among threads</h2>
<p>When a thread is intended to provide data to another thread or get
data from another thread it is reasonable to create a storage for
exchanging data among the threads so that no need to wait each
other’s participation in the processes of reading and writing.</p>
