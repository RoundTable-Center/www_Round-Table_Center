According to codding symbols by numbers concept ag85csnc1:
1. For encoding messages items into numbers space:
	1.1 Numbers space is distributed over the following each of which is optional:
		1.1.1. to designate element which can be one of the following type (so that messages make sense for the specific application):
			a. alphabets items; if numbers of numbers space are ordered, items of an alphabet have to be ordered in alphabetic order though ordered part of numbers space;
			b. alphabet authenticators;
			c. hierarchical message sentences delimiters;
			d. hierarchical contextual items delimiters;
			e. message tables start marker;
			e. message table rows delimiter;
			f. numbers reserved for free usage by application;
			g. numbers reserved for usage in future;
		1.1.2. for increasing reliability;
		1.1.3. for application grammar linking.
	1.2. Distributing number spaces for reliability and for application grammar linking either mixed with message elements, or separately or as combination of these both is implementation defined;
2. For sequences of messages items:
	2.1. Sequences of messages items can be separated into flows (so that there is not empty flows) in implementation defined way;
	2.2. Specification how to combine the flows into the message is implementation defined;
3. Tables start with tables start marker which is followed by delimited by message table rows delimiters rows which in turn contain delimited by hierarchical contextual items delimiters values of the cells of the table.
